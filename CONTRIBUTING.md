## Filing Bugs

If you're experiencing behavior that appears to be a bug in RStudio, you're welcome to [file an issue](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/new). Before you do, please go through this pre-flight checklist:

1. Is the source of the error or problem the RStudio IDE itself? Many errors you see inside RStudio come from R or R packages. If you're having trouble with R, read [Getting Help with R](https://www.r-project.org/help.html) for pointers.

2. Is your issue a bug rather than a question? If you're having general trouble with RStudio or have questions for the RStudio community, the [RStudio Community Forum](https://forum.posit.co/c/rstudio-ide) is an excellent resource.

3. Are you the first person to report this issue? [Search the issue list](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues) to find out. If you aren't, the most helpful thing you can do is vote for the existing issue (add a +1 reaction to it), and optionally add a comment describing your own experience.

When you're ready to file an issue, see our [guide to writing good bug reports](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/wiki/Writing-Good-Bug-Reports) for more on how to write a great bug report.

## Enhancements

You're also welcome to submit ideas for enhancements to RStudio. When doing so, please [search the issue list](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been filed. If it has, vote for it (add a reaction to it) and optionally add a comment with your perspective on the idea. 

See our [guide to writing feature requests](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/wiki/Writing-Good-Feature-Requests) for more on how to write a great feature request.
