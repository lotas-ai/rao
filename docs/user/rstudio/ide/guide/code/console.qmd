The **Console** in RStudio includes a variety of features intended to make interactively working with code more productive and straightforward. This documentation reviews these features. Learning to use these features along with the related features available in the [Source](execution.html) pane can have a substantial payoff in your overall productivity.

## Code completion

RStudio supports the automatic completion of code using the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key. For example, if an object named `pollResults` exists in the workspace, typing `poll` in the R console and then pressing the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key automatically completes the full name of the object. 

The code completion feature also provides inline help for functions whenever possible. For example, typing `med` and then pressing **Tab** would result in a popup of possible auto-completion:

Code completion also works for function arguments, so typing `median(` and then pressing **Tab** will result in the possible arguments being displayed:

## Retrieving previous commands

As with the standard R console, the RStudio console supports the ability to recall previous commands using the arrow keys:

-   **Up** --- Recall previous command(s)

-   **Down** --- Reverse of Up

To reuse recently executed commands, use the <kbd>Ctrl+Up</kbd> shortcut to review the list (on Mac <kbd>Command-Up</kbd>) and then select a command from this list by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>:

The same keyboard shortcut can quickly search for commands that match a given prefix. For example, to search for previous instances of the `glimpse` function start typing `glimpse` and then press <kbd>Ctrl+Up</kbd>  (on Mac <kbd>Cmd+Up</kbd>):

## Console title bar

The screenshot below illustrates a few additional capabilities provided by the Console title bar:

-   Display of the current version of R and working directory.

-   The ability to interrupt R during a long computation.

-   Minimizing and maximizing the Console in relation to the Source pane (using the buttons at the top-right or by double-clicking the title bar).

- There are two additional tabs **Terminal** and **Background Jobs** which are covered in the [Terminal](../tools/terminal.html) and [Background Jobs](../tools/jobs.html) sections of the User Guide.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Beyond the history and code-completion oriented keyboard shortcuts described above, there are a wide variety of other shortcuts available. Some of the more useful shortcuts include:

-   <kbd>Ctrl+1</kbd> --- Move focus to the Source Editor

-   <kbd>Ctrl+2</kbd> --- Move focus to the Console

-   <kbd>Ctrl+L</kbd> --- Clear the Console

-   <kbd>Esc</kbd> --- Interrupt R

-   <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+F10</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd+Shift+F10</kbd> (Mac) - Restart R

-   <kbd>Ctrl+Up</kbd> or <kbd>Command-Up</kbd> on Mac --- Display recently executed commands from the console
