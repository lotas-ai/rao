Diagnostic reports can be created within a working session, or from outside a session on a terminal.

## In an RStudio session

From the menu, click **Help** > **Diagnostics** > **Write Diagnostics Report**.

## Outside of an RStudio session

If RStudio is not starting, run a diagnostics report using the following method. Additionally, you need to provide the contents of the started terminal session.

### Windows

Run a diagnostics report by typing the following command into **Start** > **Run**:

```powershell
"C:\Program Files\RStudio\rao.exe" --run-diagnostics
```

The diagnostics report is placed in your user's Documents directory in a directory called `rstudio-diagnostics`. For example: `C:\Users\Username\Documents\rstudio-diagnostics\diagnostics-report.txt`

If you installed RStudio to a location other than `C:\Program Files`, specify this unique location in the command.

### macOS

```zsh
/Applications/RStudio.app/Contents/MacOS/RStudio --run-diagnostics
```

The diagnostics report is placed in your user home directory For example: `~/rstudio-diagnostics/diagnostics-report.txt`.
