RStudio supports syntax highlighting and other specialized code-editing features for specific file types:

-   Scripts in R, Python, SQL  
-   Computational and scientific documents in Quarto, R Markdown, and TeX  
-   Web content such as HTML and CSS  
-   and many more  

## File Menu

You can create a new file via the **File -\> New File** menu:

An alternative workflow is to use the visual elements in the RStudio menu.

To open an existing file, use either the **File -\> Open File\...** menu or the **Recent Files** menu to select from recently opened files.

## Files tab

The **Output** pane has a **Files** tab that includes several buttons for managing files within the currently selected folder, including the **New Blank File** drop-down, **Delete** button, and the **Rename** button. These buttons will operate on files that are selected within the **Files tab**.

The **More** drop-down contains a number of other useful features:  

- Copy or Move selected file(s) to a new location
- Open selected file(s) in **Source** pane or new columns
- Modify or navigate to the working directory
- Open a new terminal from the displayed folder
- Open the displayed folder in a new pop-out window
- Show hidden files

### Existing files

To open existing files from the **Files** tab, use the **Files** tab to navigate to the folder that contains your file. Then click on the file of interest to open it in the **Source** pane of RStudio.

To modify existing files from the **Files** tab, select the checkbox next the file(s) of interest, then use the UI elements such as **Delete** or **More** > **Move...**.

### Display hidden files

RStudioâ€™s **Files** tab by default shows only a selection of commonly needed hidden files, such as the .Rprofile. To instead show all of the hidden files, in the **Files** pane, click the **More** drop-down, then check **Show Hidden Files**.

## Switching files

If several files are opened within RStudio, then they are all available as tabs within the **Source** pane to facilitate quick switching between open documents.

Use the <kbd>Ctrl+Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+Tab</kbd> shortcuts on desktop (<kbd>Ctrl+F12</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl+F11</kbd> on Linux) to quickly move to the next or previous tabs, respectively.

If there are a large number of open documents, navigate between them using the "**\>\>"** icon at the end of the tab bar (<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+.</kbd> shortcut or the **View -\> Switch to Tab\...** menu item). The **Switch to Tab...** provides a filtering search for all of the tabs in that **Source** pane:

To quickly navigate to any existing file in the current RStudio Project, even if it is not currently open, use the <kbd>Ctrl + .</kbd> shortcut. Entering the shortcut will bring up the **Go to File/Function** search bar with auto-completion of file names.
