## RStudio 2022-12.0 "Elsbeth Geranium" Release Notes

### New

- RStudio now displays a splash screen on startup, while the R session is being initialized. (#11604)
- Updated RStudio Desktop installer on Windows to detect running RStudio by process name. (#10588)

### R

- Improved handling of diagnostics within pipeline expressions. (#11780)
- Improved handling of diagnostics within glue() expressions.
- Completions within R Markdown documents now respect the `knitr` `root.dir` chunk option if set. (#12047)
- RStudio now provides autocompletion results for packages used but not loaded within a project.
- Improved handling of missing arguments for some functions in the diagnostics system.
- Code editor can show previews of color in strings (R named colors e.g. "tomato3" or of the forms "#rgb", "#rrggbb", "#rrggbbaa") when `Options > Code > Display > [ ]Â enable preview of named and hexadecimal colors` is checked.
- Fixes the bug introduced with `rlang` >= 1.03 where Rmd documents show the error message `object 'partition_yaml_front_matter' not found` upon project startup. (#11552)
- Name autocompletion following a `$` now correctly quotes names that start with underscore followed by alphanumeric characters. (#11689)
- Suspended sessions will now default to using the project directory, rather than the user home directory, if the prior working directory is no longer accessible. (#11960)
- The fuzzy finder indexes C(++) macros. (#11981)
- Improved handling for large amounts of `message()` output in the Console pane. (#12059)

- Chunk output calls `format()` method on vctrs-based classes stored in a dataframe. (#6878)
  
### Python

- RStudio attempts to infer the appropriate version of Python when "Automatically activate project-local Python environments" is checked and the user has not requested a specific version of Python. This Python will be stored in the environment variable "RETICULATE_PYTHON_FALLBACK", available from the R console, the Python REPL, and the RStudio Terminal (#9990)
- Shiny for Python apps now display a "Run App" button on the Source editor toolbar. (Requires `shiny` Python package v0.2.7 or later.)

### Quarto

- Support for v2 format of Quarto crossref index
- Support for RHEL7 and CentOS7 and fixes missing Pandoc for RMarkdown (rstudio-pro#3804)

### Posit Workbench

- Rebranded Workbench from RStudio Workbench to Posit Workbench to match Posit Software, PBC's new branding terminology and iconography
- Adds `-l` (long) option to `rserver-url`. When `/usr/lib/rstudio-server/bin/rserver-url -l <port number>` is executed within a VS Code or Jupyter session, the full URL where a user can view a server proxied at that port is displayed (rstudio-pro#3620)
- Support `launcher-local-proxy` load balancing option to ensure that session requests are always proxied from the local workbench server in a cluster. Eliminates the need to open a range of ports in the firewall for sessions to be reached by other workbench servers (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3670)
- Redesigned the session launch dialog from the homepage to show all session types at once (rstudio-pro#3646)
- Enabled the Job Launcher with the Local Launcher by default in clean installations of Workbench (rstudio-pro#3571)
- Enabled all session types (Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, RStudio Pro, and VS Code) by default in clean installations of Workbench and added warnings to the Session Launch dialog and the Posit Workbench log when the components for a session type is not installed (rstudio-pro#3689)
- Add support for disabling RStudio Pro sessions (rstudio-pro#3642)

#### Posit Workbench VS Code Sessions

- Install VS Code session support (code-server) with Posit Workbench instead of requiring a separate download (rstudio-pro#3643)
- Updated code-server to version 4.7.1 (VS Code version 1.71.2) (rstudio-pro#3643)
- Sets the `UVICORN_ROOT_PATH` environment variable to the proxied port URL for port 8000 in VS Code and Jupyter sessions, allowing FastAPI applications to run without additional configuration. (rstudio-pro#2660)
- Workbench now checks for the `code-server` binary in the `WORKBENCH_VSCODE_PATH` environment variable (if present) then the `vscode-exe` setting in `vscode.conf`, or falls back to the preinstalled version and finally the `PATH`. This allows more flexibility when launching sessions on Kubernetes or Slurm clusters. (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3942)
- Add support for launching Workbench Jobs through VS Code Sessions (rstudio-pro#3565)

#### Posit Workbench VS Code Extension

- Install VS Code Extension with Posit Workbench instead of requiring a separate download (rstudio-pro#3643)
- Introduce Workbench Job management to VS Code Extension (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3784, rstudio/rstudio-pro#3565)
- Added a pop-up notification when working with certain relevant filetypes that makes it easier to find the Workbench Extension. This notification is a one-time view per user. It can be re-enabled in the user settings (vscode-ext#96).
- Rebranded the interface to match Posit Software, PBC's new branding terminology and iconography
- Fixed extension servers appearing in Proxied Servers list (vscode-ext#116)
- Added support for Flask, including a help dialog and the Posit Workbench Flask Interface code snippet, for proxying Flask applications (rstudio-pro#2660)
- Added a FastAPI help dialog and the following code snippets for setting the root_path in FastAPI applications (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3698):
    - Posit Workbench Uvicorn Root Path Snippet
    - Posit Workbench FastAPI Uvicorn Root Path Snippet
- Added a Warning notification that appears when a uvicorn process was started with a custom port, without the root-path argument. These processes will now appear in the Proxied Servers view with a warning icon (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3699)
- Fixed mislabelling of Shiny app in Proxied Servers list (#117)

#### Posit Workbench Jupyter Sessions

- Workbench now checks for the `jupyter` binary in the `WORKBENCH_JUPYTER_PATH` environment variable (if present), then the `jupyter-exe` setting in `jupyter.conf`, and finally the `PATH`. This is allows more flexibility when launching sessions on Kubernetes or Slurm clusters. (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3942)
- Fixed an issue where Workbench would not install the `jupyter` extension automatically if the configured `jupyter` path was a symlink to the actual install location. We now follow the symlink. (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3942)
- Disabled `session-cull-timeout` in `jupyter.conf` by default for clean installations of Workbench to prevent possible data loss due to Jupyter storing all state in the browser (rstudio-pro#4010)

#### Posit Workbench Jupyter Extension

- The Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab extensions have been updated to match with the new Posit Software, PBC branding (rstudio-pro#3645)

### Deprecated / Removed

- Removed the Tools / Shell command (#11253)
- Deprecated the vscode.conf "min-ext-version" option for specifying the minimum version of the Posit Workbench VS Code extension as the extension is now bundled with Workbench and Session packages rather than being downloaded (rstudio-pro#3643)
- Removed the "rstudio-server install-vs-code" admin command for downloading and configuring code-server; code-server is now installed with Workbench, use the "rstudio-server configure-vs-code" command for configuration (rstudio-pro#3643)
- It is highly recommended that you disable session culling in Jupyter sessions by done by setting `session-cull-minutes=0` in `jupyter.conf` to prevent potential data loss (rstudio-pro#3054) 

### Experimental ARM64 and RedHat 9 support

- Experimental (preview) support for Linux `aarch64` platforms, such as the Raspberry Pi and AWS Graviton
- Experimental (preview) support for RedHat Enterprise Linux 9 and compatible platforms, such as Rocky Linux 9

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where Find in Files could omit matches in some cases on Windows (#11736)
- Fixed an issue where the Git History window inverted the display of merge diffs (#10150)
- Fixed an issue where Find in Files could fail to find results with certain versions of git (#11822)

- RStudio sessions now shut down and suspend properly when they receive a `SIGTERM` signal, as they have for `SIGUSR2` (rstudio/rstudio-pro#2585)
- Fixed an issue where `ssl-hsts-include-subdomains=1` would render Workbench non-functional. The setting now works as expected. (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3010)
- Fixed an issue where the `suspend-session`, `suspend-all`, and `kill-all` subcommands of `rstudio-server` did not work when using the Launcher. (rstudio/rstudio-pro#4007)
- Fixed conflicting keyboard shortcut for toggling screen reader support on macOS (#12339)
- Fixed issue with session-ssl that prevented resuming some sessions in a load-balanced environment (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3759)
- Fixed intermittent problem where sessions in the Posit Workbench homepage would display incorrect status over NFS (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3979)
- Fixed an issue where Workbench Job output would somtimes fail to show (rstudio-pro#3972)
- Fixed an issue where reactivating a user could result in an erroneous warning that user license limit had been reached (rstudio-pro#3874)
