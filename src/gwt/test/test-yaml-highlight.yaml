# Check handling of comments.
comments:
- Some text. # This is a comment.
- Some text# This is not a comment!
- Some#text#with#embedded#hashes. # A real comment.
- # This is a comment. The entry here should be parsed as NULL.
- true # Keywords can have comments after them.
- 42.0 # So can numbers.

text:
- This is a string. It has numbers like 1, 2, and 3.
- The next few lines are plain numbers, and should be highlighted like so.
- 42.0
- -35.5

strings:
- "This is a
   multi-line string.
   It has some escapes: \a.
   \"These are embedded quotes.\""

- 'This is a
   multi-line string.
   Quotes are escaped by ''doubling'' them.'
   
- >
   This is a multi-line string.
   It doesn't end until the indent decreases
   below the initial indent.

   For example, this is still part of the string:
   section:
      sub-section:
         value

   The next part is no longer part of the string.

lists:
- section: ["a", b42, 42.0, no, 64.0]
- section: [
   "a",
   b42,
   42.0,
   true,
   64.0
]

dictionaries:
- { "a": 42, "b": 64 }
- { "c": 64, "d": 86 }
